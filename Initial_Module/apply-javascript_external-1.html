    <!-- Here is wrong way - place the script at the begining!
  Note: The reason the above instructions place the <script> element near the bottom of the HTML file is that the browser reads code in the order it appears in the file.
  If the JavaScript loads first and it is supposed to affect the HTML that hasn't loaded yet, there could be problems. Placing JavaScript near the bottom of an HTML page is one way to accommodate this dependency. -->
